# Real-Time-Intrusion-Detection-System-with-Splunk-Python-and-Linux
This project aims to develop a Real-Time Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that monitors network traffic on Linux servers and utilizes Python for analyzing and detecting potential intrusions. It leverages Splunk as the central platform for data aggregation, analysis, and visualization.
Technologies Used:
Splunk Enterprise: For data aggregation, analysis, and visualization.
Python: For scripting and machine learning implementation.
Linux: As the operating system for servers and network traffic capturing.
Scapy (Python library): For packet analysis.
Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., scikit-learn): For attack pattern recognition.
Setup and Installation:
Prerequisites:
A Linux server (physical or virtual).
Basic knowledge of Linux, Python, and networking.
Splunk Enterprise installation access.
Python installed on the Linux server.
Step 1: Splunk Setup
Install Splunk Enterprise: Download and install it on a Linux server.
Initial Configuration: Set up and start Splunk, then access the web interface to complete the initial setup.
Step 2: Network Traffic Monitoring
Install tcpdump: Use your Linux package manager to install tcpdump.
Traffic Capture Setup: Set up tcpdump to capture network traffic and save it to a file.
Step 3: Python Script for Packet Analysis
Install Python Libraries: Install scapy and other necessary Python libraries.
Script Development: Write a Python script to analyze the captured packets in real-time.
Step 4: Machine Learning Implementation
Data Preprocessing Script: Write a script to preprocess the captured data.
Machine Learning Model: Develop a machine learning model to identify attack patterns.
Integration with Splunk: Use Splunk's Machine Learning Toolkit to apply the model.
Step 5: Alerting and Visualization in Splunk
Splunk Alert Setup: Configure Splunk to send alerts based on detected threats.
Dashboard Creation: Develop a Splunk dashboard for real-time monitoring.
Testing and Optimization:
Perform thorough testing by simulating various network attacks.
Optimize the machine learning model and alert thresholds based on test results.
Documentation and Maintenance:
Document the entire setup and configuration process.
Establish a routine for updating scripts, models, and Splunk configurations.
