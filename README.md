# Real-Time-Intrusion-Detection-System-with-Splunk-Python-and-Linux
This project aims to develop a Real-Time Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that monitors network traffic on Linux servers and utilizes Python for analyzing and detecting potential intrusions. It leverages Splunk as the central platform for data aggregation, analysis, and visualization.

Project: Real-Time Intrusion Detection System with Splunk and Python
Description
This project involves creating a real-time Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Splunk, Python, and Linux. The goal is to monitor network traffic on Linux servers, analyze it for potential security threats using Python, and leverage Splunk for data aggregation, analysis, and visualization.

Objectives
Monitor network traffic in real-time.
Detect potential intrusions like DDoS, port scanning, and unauthorized access attempts.
Utilize machine learning for pattern recognition and threat detection.
Generate alerts for detected threats.
Visualize network traffic and threats using Splunk dashboards.
Technologies Used
Splunk Enterprise: For data aggregation, analysis, and visualization.
Python: For scripting, data analysis, and implementing machine learning models.
Linux: As the operating system for hosting Splunk and network traffic monitoring tools.
Scapy (Python Library): For packet analysis.
Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., scikit-learn): For developing and training intrusion detection models.
Project Setup
Splunk Enterprise Setup:

Install and configure Splunk Enterprise on a Linux server.
Set up Splunk Web and create an administrator account.
Network Traffic Monitoring:

Install and configure tcpdump or Wireshark on Linux servers.
Set up mechanisms to capture and forward traffic data to Splunk.
Packet Analysis with Python:

Develop Python scripts using scapy to analyze network packets.
Integrate these scripts with Splunk for real-time data processing.
Machine Learning Implementation:

Preprocess and clean network traffic data using Python.
Develop and train machine learning models for intrusion detection.
Integrate these models with Splunk for real-time analysis.
Alerting and Visualization:

Set up alerts in Splunk for detected intrusions.
Create dashboards in Splunk for monitoring and visualization.
